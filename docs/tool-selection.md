# Tool Selection & Rationale

## Decision: Strategic Custom Build (with platforms for production)

### Core Stack Choices

#### 1. Backend: FastAPI (Custom)
**Why FastAPI?**
- ✅ High performance (async support)
- ✅ Automatic API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- ✅ Python ecosystem (best for AI/ML)
- ✅ Type hints with Pydantic
- ✅ Easy AI SDK integration

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Express.js: Less AI library support
- Django: Heavier, slower development
- No-code (Bubble backend): Limited AI orchestration control

**Decision**: Custom backend needed for complex AI orchestration logic

---

#### 2. Frontend: Next.js 14 (Framework)
**Why Next.js?**
- ✅ React with server components
- ✅ TypeScript support
- ✅ App Router for modern routing
- ✅ Excellent developer experience
- ✅ Vercel deployment (easy)

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Bubble: Too restrictive for complex chat UI
- Retool: Better for internal tools, not client-facing

**Decision**: Needed control for AI chat interfaces and real-time updates

---

#### 3. Database: Supabase (Platform)
**Why Supabase?**
- ✅ PostgreSQL (production-grade)
- ✅ Built-in authentication
- ✅ Row Level Security
- ✅ Real-time subscriptions
- ✅ Auto-generated REST API
- ✅ Free tier for development

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Raw PostgreSQL: Would need to build auth
- Firebase: Less SQL flexibility
- Airtable: Good for prototypes but not scalable

**Decision**: Supabase gives us platform benefits (auth, realtime) with custom control

---

#### 4. AI: Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4.5 (API)
**Why Claude?**
- ✅ Best-in-class reasoning
- ✅ Conversational capabilities
- ✅ 200K context window
- ✅ Reliable JSON output
- ✅ Strong at analysis tasks

**Future Multi-AI Strategy:**
- GPT-4 Turbo: Fast categorization, structured data
- GPT-4 Vision: Receipt OCR, document parsing
- Specialized models: Financial forecasting

**Decision**: Claude for prototype, multi-AI for production

---

## Why Custom vs No-Code Platforms?

### Current Approach (Prototype)
**Custom build for:**
- Complex AI orchestration logic
- Unique conversation flows
- Learning and demonstrating coding skills
- Flexibility for rapid iteration

### Production Approach (2-Month Deployment)
**Would add platforms:**
- **Retool**: Admin dashboards (3 days)
- **n8n**: Workflow automation (2 days)
- **Airtable**: Client-facing data views (if appropriate)
- **Custom AI Layer**: Unique value proposition

**Hybrid strategy = Speed + Control**

## Cost Analysis for 50 Clients

### Infrastructure Costs (Monthly)

**Current Stack:**
- Supabase Pro: $25/mo
- Vercel Pro: $20/mo
- Railway/Render: $7-15/mo
- Anthropic API: ~$300/mo (estimated 1M tokens)
- **Total Base: ~$360/mo**

**Cost per client: $7.20/mo**

### With Platforms (Production Phase 2)

**Additional:**
- Retool Team (3 users): $150/mo
- n8n Cloud: $20/mo
- **Total: ~$530/mo**

**Cost per client: $10.60/mo**

### Revenue Model
**Pricing: $99-199/client/mo**
- Infrastructure: $10.60/client
- Gross margin: 89-95%
- **Highly profitable at scale**

### Break-even Analysis
- Fixed costs: $530/mo
- Break-even: 6 clients @ $99/mo
- 50 clients revenue: $4,950-9,950/mo
- 50 clients profit: $4,420-9,420/mo

## 2-Month Deployment Strategy

### Month 1: Platform Setup
- Week 1: Airtable database structure
- Week 2: n8n workflow automation
- Week 3: Retool admin dashboards
- Week 4: Custom AI integration layer

### Month 2: Polish & Launch
- Week 1: Frontend client portal
- Week 2: Testing + bug fixes
- Week 3: Migration toolkit
- Week 4: Soft launch with 3 pilot clients

**Key**: Platforms handle CRUD, we focus on AI differentiation

## Technology Comparison

| Feature | Custom (Current) | With Platforms |
|---------|------------------|----------------|
| Development Time | 6-8 weeks | 4-6 weeks |
| Flexibility | High | Medium |
| Maintenance | Higher | Lower |
| Speed to Market | Slower | Faster |
| Learning Curve | Steep | Moderate |
| Cost | Lower | Higher |
| Best For | Prototype | Production |

## Key Insight

**Assessment Goal**: Show we understand WHEN to use platforms vs custom

**Our Approach:**
1. Custom for unique AI value (can't be replicated)
2. Platforms for standard features (CRUD, dashboards, workflows)
3. Hybrid = Best of both worlds

**For this 7-day assessment**: Demonstrated coding + AI skills with custom build

**For 2-month production**: Would add platforms for speed while keeping custom AI core
