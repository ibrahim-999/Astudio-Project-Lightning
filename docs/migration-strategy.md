# Migration & Onboarding Strategy

## Goal: Client Operational in Under 2 Hours

## Overview

Most agencies struggle with ERP migration taking weeks or months. Our AI-powered approach reduces this to hours with zero business disruption.

## Magic Import System

### Phase 1: Intelligent File Upload

**User Action:**
1. Drag & drop ANY file:
    - CSV from old system
    - Excel spreadsheets
    - QuickBooks export
    - Emails with project info
    - Even PDFs or images

**AI Actions:**
1. Detect file type and structure
2. Identify data types (projects, employees, expenses)
3. Map fields to our schema
4. Clean and validate data
5. Preview before import
6. Confirm with user
7. Import in seconds

---

### Phase 2: Schema Mapping

**Traditional Migration:**
```
Manual mapping:
Old System "Project Title" ‚Üí Our "project_name"
Old System "Cost" ‚Üí Our "amount"
... (50+ fields to map manually)
Time: 4-6 hours
```

**AI-Powered Migration:**
```
AI analyzes structure:
"I see columns: Project Title, Cost, Start Date
I'll map these to: project_name, budget, start_date
Confidence: 95%
Proceed?"

Time: 2 minutes
```

---

### Phase 3: Data Quality AI

**Problems AI Fixes:**
- Inconsistent dates: "1/5/23", "Jan 5 2023", "2023-01-05" ‚Üí Standardized
- Missing data: AI fills reasonable defaults or asks
- Duplicates: AI detects and merges
- Invalid entries: AI flags for review
- Wrong types: AI converts automatically

**Example:**
```
Old System:
Employee: "john", Email: "john@email", Salary: "50k"

AI Cleaning:
Employee: "John Smith"
Email: "john@email.com" (AI added .com)
Salary: 50000 (converted to number)
Status: "Review email - AI added domain"
```

---

## Migration Process

### Step 1: Discovery (10 minutes)
**AI Interview:**
```
AI: "What systems are you currently using?"
User: "QuickBooks for accounting, Trello for projects, Google Sheets for team"

AI: "Got it! Can you export data from each? Just give me:
     - QuickBooks: Expenses report (any format)
     - Trello: Board export (JSON or CSV)
     - Google Sheets: Share link or download"

User: [Uploads 3 files]

AI: "Perfect! I see:
     - 247 expenses from QuickBooks
     - 18 active projects from Trello
     - 12 team members from Google Sheets
     Ready to import?"
```

---

### Step 2: Import & Validation (30 minutes)

**AI Actions:**
1. **Expenses (QuickBooks)**
    - Maps vendor names
    - Categorizes automatically
    - Links to projects where mentioned
    - Flags unusual amounts

2. **Projects (Trello)**
    - Imports boards as projects
    - Cards become tasks
    - Due dates ‚Üí timeline
    - Labels ‚Üí priorities

3. **Team (Google Sheets)**
    - Creates employee records
    - Sends invites automatically
    - Assigns based on project history

**AI Output:**
```
‚úÖ Imported successfully:
   - 247 expenses (3 need review)
   - 18 projects with 94 tasks
   - 12 team members (invites sent)
   
‚ö†Ô∏è Manual Review Needed:
   - 3 expenses over $5,000 (approval flow)
   - 2 projects missing end dates (AI estimated)
   
üí° AI Insights:
   - Top expense category: Software ($12,450/month)
   - Most active project: Website Redesign (15 tasks)
   - Team capacity: 87% utilized
```

---

### Step 3: Configuration (20 minutes)

**AI Wizard:**
```
AI: "Let me set up your company profile."

AI: "I noticed you spend heavily on Adobe, Figma, and Webflow.
     Should I categorize these as 'Design Tools'?"

User: "Yes"

AI: "Done! Created custom category. I also see you bill clients
     by project. Want me to track time per project?"

User: "Yes"

AI: "Perfect! I'll add time tracking to all project tasks.
     One more thing - you have recurring expenses like hosting ($149/month).
     Should I auto-create these each month?"

User: "Yes please"

AI: "All set! Your system is ready. Want a tour?"
```

---

### Step 4: Training (40 minutes)

**AI-Guided Tour:**
- AI shows key features
- Interactive walkthroughs
- Role-based tutorials
- "Try it now" exercises

**No Manual Reading Required:**
```
AI: "Let's try creating an expense. Just tell me:
     'Coffee meeting with client, $23'"

User: "Coffee meeting with client, $23"

AI: "Perfect! I:
     ‚úÖ Created expense
     ‚úÖ Categorized as Client Meetings
     ‚úÖ Linked to active client project
     ‚úÖ Added to this month's budget
     
     That's all you need! Natural language, and I handle the rest."
```

```python
def analyze_file(file):
    """AI determines what data is in the file"""
    return {
        'type': 'expenses',  # or 'projects', 'employees'
        'structure': {...},   # detected columns
        'row_count': 247,
        'data_quality': 'good',
        'issues': []
    }
```

### 2. Schema Mapper
```python
def map_schema(old_structure, new_schema):
    """AI maps old fields to new fields"""
    return {
        'mappings': {
            'Project Title': 'project_name',
            'Cost': 'amount',
            'Date': 'expense_date'
        },
        'confidence': 0.95
    }
```

### 3. Data Cleaner
```python
def clean_data(raw_data, mappings):
    """AI fixes common data issues"""
    return {
        'cleaned_data': [...],
        'fixes_applied': [
            'Standardized dates',
            'Fixed 3 email addresses',
            'Removed 5 duplicates'
        ]
    }
```

### 4. Import Validator
```python
def validate_import(cleaned_data):
    """AI checks for issues before import"""
    return {
        'ready': True,
        'warnings': ['3 high-value expenses need approval'],
        'estimated_time': '30 seconds'
    }
```
